 ## What The Project Does?

For my music app, I have created a tracklist with three of my favorite songs. The music player has a functioning play, pause, and skip buttons, as well as the ability to drag
the progress bar while displaying the track name and artist.

         
 ## Why it's useful?

Making this project was useful for me personally in many ways. It covered various methods in JavaScript. One of the topics I learned while tackling this project was the 
video API. Also, I had the opportunity to learn about some event listeners I had never heard of, like the "change" and "ended" events. In addition, as one of my first projects, 
it gave me the opportunity to build something while enjoying the process and the project itself. Building this project provided me with the stepping stones to develop more complicated 
projects in the near future.
